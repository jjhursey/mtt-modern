Variations of workflows
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
For all workflows we need to go through the workflow with the following options
 Note: If there are multiple pages of results we want to know the:
       - Cost of displaying the first page
       - Cost of navigating to each page in order
       - Total cost of navigating through the whole set of pages

 - Time ranges:
    - Past 24 hours
      [Simulated as: 2015-04-09 00:00:00 - 2015-04-10 00:00:00
    - Past 48 hours
      [Simulated as: 2015-04-08 00:00:00 - 2015-04-10 00:00:00
    - Past 1 week:

Notes on search parameters
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
 - For Org.
   "cisco" is a good choice, then run lots of tests
 - For MPI Name
   "ompi-nightly-master" is a good choice, it is the most frequently tested
 - For MPI Version
   "dev-NNN-..." where NNNN is the largest number, that is the latest build
 - For compiler
   "gnu" is the most popular choice

 4) Sort by MPI Version
    [Broken in the MTT Reporter, but time anyway]
